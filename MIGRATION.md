# Migrating from QuickBooks Desktop to BookKeeper AI

A practical, step-by-step guide for moving a company file from QuickBooks
Desktop (Pro/Premier/Enterprise) into BookKeeper AI.

> **TL;DR:** Export your lists as IIF and a Trial Balance report from QuickBooks,
> import them in the order *Chart of Accounts → Customers/Vendors → Items →
> Classes → Employees → opening balances/transactions*, then run the
> verification checklist at the bottom before retiring the old file.

## 1. What you need to know first

### Known limitations

- **No direct `.QBB` / `.QBW` read.** BookKeeper AI cannot open QuickBooks
  company files (`.QBW`) or QuickBooks backups (`.QBB`) directly — these are
  proprietary, encrypted formats. Migration goes through QuickBooks' own
  **IIF exports** (lists) and **reports** (balances).
- **History vs. opening balances.** The practical, recommended approach is to
  bring over your **lists + opening balances as of a cutover date** and keep
  the old QuickBooks file for historical reference. Re-keying or importing
  years of transaction history is possible (IIF transactions, bank-file
  re-imports) but rarely worth the effort.
- **Payroll history** does not transfer line-by-line. Set up payroll items and
  employees fresh, and enter year-to-date totals as opening balances if you
  migrate mid-year.
- **Memorized reports, custom templates, and attachments** do not transfer.
  Re-create the reports you actually use; re-attach critical documents.

## 2. Export from QuickBooks Desktop

All exports below are from the QuickBooks Desktop menus.

1. **Lists as IIF**
   `File → Utilities → Export → Lists to IIF Files…`
   Tick at minimum: **Chart of Accounts, Customer List, Vendor List, Item
   List, Class List, Employee List**. Save the `.IIF` file(s).
2. **Trial Balance (opening balances)**
   `Reports → Accountant & Taxes → Trial Balance`. Set the date to your
   cutover date (typically the last day of the prior fiscal period — e.g.
   Dec 31). `Excel → Create New Worksheet` or export to CSV.
3. **Open invoices / unpaid bills** (so receivables and payables stay
   document-level, not just a lump sum):
   - `Reports → Customers & Receivables → Open Invoices` → export CSV.
   - `Reports → Vendors & Payables → Unpaid Bills Detail` → export CSV.
4. **Inventory valuation** (if you track inventory):
   `Reports → Inventory → Inventory Valuation Summary` as of the cutover date.
5. **Optional — bank history:** download the last 30–90 days from your bank as
   **QFX/OFX/QBO/CSV** for re-import into BookKeeper's Banking module.

Close the books in QuickBooks as of the cutover date so nothing changes under
you while migrating.

## 3. Import into BookKeeper AI — in this order

Order matters: each step references records created by the previous one.

1. **Create the company** (File → New Company / first-run setup). Set the
   fiscal-year start to match QuickBooks.
2. **Chart of Accounts** — Import page → QuickBooks IIF import (`!ACCNT`
   sections), or List Import via CSV. Verify account types/subtypes after
   import; A/R and A/P accounts must keep their special subtypes.
3. **Customers and Vendors** — IIF (`!CUST`, `!VEND`) or CSV list import.
   Jobs/sub-customers come in under their parent customers.
4. **Items** — IIF (`!INVITEM`) or CSV. Check that each item's income/expense
   (and inventory asset/COGS) account mapping survived. BookKeeper supports
   the full QB item-type set including other charge, discount, subtotal,
   payment, and sales-tax items.
5. **Classes** — IIF (`!CLASS`) or create manually (usually a short list).
6. **Sales tax** — create Tax Agencies and Tax Rates (and combined rates) to
   match your QB sales-tax items/groups.
7. **Employees & payroll items** — IIF (`!EMP`) or manual entry; then set up
   payroll items (wage, tax, deduction) to mirror your QB payroll item list.
8. **Opening balances / transactions**
   - Post one **opening journal entry** dated the cutover date from the QB
     Trial Balance (every account, debits = credits; the offset, if any, goes
     to Opening Balance Equity).
   - **Important:** exclude A/R, A/P, and Inventory from that entry if you
     load them at document level in the next steps (otherwise they double).
   - Re-enter **open invoices** and **unpaid bills** as real documents dated
     with their original dates (Open Invoices / Unpaid Bills exports are your
     checklist). Their postings recreate the A/R and A/P balances.
   - Enter **inventory quantities on hand** (item opening quantities/values
     per the Valuation Summary) to rebuild the Inventory Asset balance.
9. **Banking** — add bank accounts, then import recent OFX/QFX/QBO/CSV files.
   Use the CSV mapper's preview before committing. Matched transactions up to
   the cutover should be excluded (they're already in the opening balances).
10. **Set the closing date** to the cutover date (Settings) so nobody back-posts
    into the migrated period, and take a **backup** (Backup & Restore page).

## 4. Verify-your-data checklist

Run these checks in BookKeeper AI against the same reports from QuickBooks
**as of the cutover date** before you stop using the old file:

- [ ] **Trial Balance** matches QuickBooks line for line (run Reports → Trial
      Balance). Total debits = total credits.
- [ ] **Balance Sheet** total assets/liabilities/equity match.
- [ ] **A/R Aging Summary** matches, and the **count and total of open
      invoices** equals QB's Open Invoices report.
- [ ] **A/P Aging Summary** matches, and unpaid bill count/total equals QB's
      Unpaid Bills Detail.
- [ ] **Inventory Valuation** (quantity and value per item) matches.
- [ ] **Bank account balances** match the bank statement and the QB register.
- [ ] Spot-check 5–10 **customers and vendors** for contact info and terms.
- [ ] Each **item** points at the correct income/expense/COGS accounts (create
      one test invoice in a draft and confirm the posting preview).
- [ ] **Sales tax rates** compute correctly on a test sale.
- [ ] **Closing date** is set and a **.bka backup** is saved off-machine.
- [ ] Run the built-in **Data Integrity** check (Integrity page) — zero issues.

Keep the QuickBooks file (read-only) for at least your statutory retention
period; historical detail you didn't migrate lives there.

## 5. Ongoing parity notes

- **Backups:** `.bka` files are portable zip archives. A *full backup* covers
  every company in the data directory; a *company backup* is a single tenant
  you can restore as a new company anywhere. BookKeeper also writes automatic
  **pre-operation backups** (last 5 kept) before restores and condense runs.
- **Condense/Archive** (QB "Condense Data" equivalent) lives on the Backup &
  Restore page: it summarizes closed-period detail to one entry per month and
  always writes a permanent archive `.bka` first. It is irreversible except by
  restoring that archive.
- **Bank imports:** OFX, QFX, QBO, and CSV are supported; CSV has a full
  column mapper (separate debit/credit columns, date format, skip rows, sign
  flip) with a preview before anything is committed.
