/**
 * State payroll income-tax withholding — approximate 2024 rates.
 *
 * DISCLAIMER: These rates are a DOCUMENTED APPROXIMATION of publicly available
 * ~2024 state income-tax withholding rules. They are provided for ESTIMATION
 * PURPOSES ONLY. State tax law changes frequently, rates vary by filing status,
 * income level, and local jurisdiction, and many states apply additional
 * deductions, credits, exemptions, or surtaxes not modeled here. Progressive
 * (graduated-bracket) states — CA, NY, NJ, MN, OR, VT, HI, CT, ME, SC, IA,
 * MO, MT, NE, ND, OH, OK, RI, VA, WI, AR, KS, LA, MD, NM — are represented
 * by a SINGLE FLAT APPROXIMATION of a mid-range effective rate for a typical
 * wage earner. These approximations can diverge significantly for very low or
 * very high incomes. ALWAYS verify against the current official state revenue
 * department guidance and use full graduated bracket tables before filing or
 * remitting payroll taxes. This code is NOT a substitute for professional tax
 * advice or a certified payroll system.
 *
 * Model used per state:
 *   - 'none'  — no state income tax on wages (rate = 0)
 *   - 'flat'  — single flat rate applied to taxable income
 *               (may be the statutory flat rate OR a mid-range approximation
 *                for a progressive-bracket state — see rateLabel for details)
 *
 * Sources (publicly available, approximate 2024):
