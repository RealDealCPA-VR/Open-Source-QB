/**
 * Cash-Basis Profit & Loss reporting.
 *
 * AccountING BASIS OVERVIEW
 * ─────────────────────────
 * Accrual basis: income is recorded when earned (invoice posted), expenses when incurred (bill
 * posted). This is the standard double-entry GL view.
 *
 * Cash basis: income is recorded only when cash is received, expenses only when cash is paid.
 * The simplest correct conversion from an accrual GL is the INDIRECT method:
 *
 *   cashIncome   = accrualIncome   − increaseInAR
 *   cashExpenses = accrualExpenses − increaseInAP
 *   netCash      = cashIncome      − cashExpenses
 *
 * Intuition:
 *  • If AR increased over the period, some revenue was billed but not yet collected → subtract it.
 *  • If AP increased over the period, some expenses were accrued but not yet paid → subtract them.
 *
 * `increaseInAR` = AR balance at period-end minus AR balance at period-start (debit-normal).
 *   Positive value → AR grew → we collected less cash than we earned.
 *
 * `increaseInAP` = AP balance at period-end minus AP balance at period-start (credit-normal,
 *   so we compare net-credit activity, i.e. credits − debits on account 2000).
 *   Positive value → AP grew → we paid less cash than we incurred in expenses.
